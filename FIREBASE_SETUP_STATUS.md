# Firebase migration status — School Manager

## Completed in this source package
- Removed Google Drive sync manager, Drive OAuth scope requests, Drive-specific background workers/scheduler, Drive backup manager, and OkHttp Drive API dependency.
- Kept the existing Room database and did not clear or upload local records.
- Admin sign-in now exchanges Google Sign-In ID token for Firebase Authentication credentials and checks the allowlisted email `shas45558@gmail.com` in the app.
- Teacher sign-in calls the trusted `teacherLogin` Firebase Callable Function and uses the returned Firebase custom token.
- Admin teacher creation calls the trusted `adminCreateTeacher` Firebase Callable Function; server-side code hashes passwords with bcrypt.
- Added Firebase Functions and coroutine Task-await dependencies. Web OAuth client ID is configured for Google ID-token requests.
- Firestore rules and Cloud Functions starter files are in `../firebase/`.

## Not yet complete / do not treat as production-ready
- Student, attendance, monthly-exam and exam-mark bidirectional Room↔Firestore synchronization is **not implemented yet**. The Sync page currently reports Firebase sign-in status and does not claim to sync records.
- Google Cloud still needs an Android OAuth client matching package `com.scl.mgr` and the release signing SHA-1; the Web client ID is not a replacement for that Android client.
- Deploy the Cloud Functions and Firestore rules before testing teacher account creation/login.
- Harden callable functions with App Check, rate limiting and production review before release.
- This source package could not be built here because the Gradle wrapper JAR is absent; the repository's GitHub Actions workflow bootstraps the wrapper before building. Run CI and test login flows before installing.

## Data safety
The cloud database is intended to start empty. Existing local Room records are left on-device and are not automatically uploaded or deleted by this migration step.
